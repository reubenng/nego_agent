# Base model tasks

## Reuben

1) Getting profile variables and storing them into a 2D matrix, string 2D matrix for mapping. [COMPLETED]
2) Make them into probabilities (using Linear Function). [COMPLETED]
3) 1st round flag. [COMPLETED]
4) Create squared normlised probability matrix and pass it to daniel (getBidFromRoulette). [COMPLETED]
5) Pass bid frequency array to Daniel. [COMPLETED]

## Daniel

1) Create uniform random vector for selecting value of each issue. [COMPLETED]
2) Implement the roulette selection method. [COMPLETED]
3) Put them into a bid using string mapping matrix. [COMPLETED]
4) Make counter offer, u(bid_offer) <= u(last_offer): accept, otherwise counter-offer(bid_offer). [COMPLETED]
5) Use 2 matrices as inputs (Aold=linear, Anew=squared and normalized) and apply time-function to return new prob. matrix [COMPLETED]
6) Make a bid with updated probabilities (A = Aold*t - Anew(t-1)) [COMPLETED]
7) Use frequency array to create a new probability matrix. [COMPLETED]
